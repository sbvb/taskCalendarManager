# taskCalendarManager
Manage tasks and sub-tasks on the top of Google Calendar.

Project being developed by students Raffael Siqueira and Emanuelle Schiavon of Computer Science Degree at UFRJ - Brazil, for discipline Software for Smartphones with Professor Sergio Barbosa Villas-Boas.

The objective is to provide to the user a percentual of concluding of tasks, helping you to organize your life and decide which task has more priority (in the case you have more than one task to the same day, for example). Each main task saves a new percentage of completion itself for each sub-task marked as completed. Sub-tasks have no completion monitor, just a checkbox to make it completed.
